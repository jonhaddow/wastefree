## Toothbrushes

One of the biggest sacrifices I feel I have personally made so far in the attempt to produce less waste is switching from an electric toothbrush to a ‘manual’ bamboo one.

The convenience of the electric toothbrush, along with the built in two minute timer, meant that my morning routine could be as mindless and habitual as possible.

However, since making the switch to a manual toothbrush, i feel i have become more attentive to my dental care. This means spending more time and effort brushing all areas of my mouth, rather than trusting the electric toothbrush to do the job for me.

I also really like the simplicity of a manual toothbrush. Being able to minimise the number of items I own, and the number of things I have to remember to charge is always a positive for me.

And, as an added bonus, it was far cheaper to purchase a bamboo toothbrush than it was to buy replacement heads for my electric toothbrush.

Also, in terms of the actual bamboo toothbrush itself, I have found it very easy to get used to, and very similar to manual plastic brushes. They also come in a range of brush strengths, and a range of prices, but essentially all do the same job!

## Dental floss

Over the last few years I have been using dental flossing harps, as i found them far easier and simpler than dental tape.

The huge disadvantage to this is the amount of plastic being sent to landfill, just by me alone. That’s 365 dental harps each year…

Therefore, when it was time to purchase some more dental floss, I decided to try out a more eco-friendly alternative.

I opted for a UK based company (reducing the emissions involved in transport) called Georganics.

This company produces their dental floss from sustainable sources such as bamboo or silk. The silk dental floss can also be composted, as it is 100% natural.

The dental floss comes in a plastic free, glass container with a metal lid that allows floss to be dispensed and cut. This makes the process a lot easier! Then, refill rolls of dental tape can be purchased from a variety of places.

The floss is sent in cardboard and paper only packaging, that can be fully recycled. This helps to further reduce waste.

The floss was super easy to use, and worked in the same way as other dental tapes. They come in a range of flavours, and are one of the cheapest options on the market.

## Mouthwash

I also switched from mouthwash purchased in a plastic bottle to Georganics mouthwash tablets.

These tablets are dissolved in 20ml of water, and swished around the mouth for 30 seconds, just like with other mouthwashes.

I found these to be really easy to use, convenient when travelling, and leave my mouth feeling refreshed.

Just like with the dental floss, these tablets come in a range of flavours, so are great for people who dislike mint.

The quantity of mouthwash tablets available differs, and I bought a years supply as it worked out cheaper. They were sent in a glass bottle for storage and once again the packaging was plastic free and fully recyclable.

## Toothpaste

This is the one area of my dental hygiene routine that i have not yet changed.

It is mostly because i would like to make sure I am keeping my teeth and gums healthy, and I am not confident with using natural or homemade products just yet.

However, this is an area that I would like to do further research on, and I will write back when I have more information or recommendations to share!

And remember, the most important thing about reducing waste and plastic usage is going at a pace you’re comfortable with and only replacing things as they need replacing. And all changes, however small, will make a difference!
