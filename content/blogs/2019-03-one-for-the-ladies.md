Another change I have made in the quest to becoming waste free, was switching from sanitary towels and tampons to a menstrual cup.

It is estimated that a woman goes through approximately 11,000 tampons and pads throughout her lifetime. The time it takes for these to degrade in landfill sites is centuries longer than the lifespan of the person using them!

When considering all woman using such products, the amount of waste really adds up. By using a reusable menstrual cup, especially those that last up to about 10 years, one full truckload of waste is saved in ten years, for each person that decides to switch to a menstrual cup.

## What is a menstrual cup?

A menstrual cup, is a flexible cup that is inserted instead of a tampon, and collects blood during periods. They come in a range of shapes and sizes, to suit all individuals. They are usually made out of rubber or silicone, and can last up to 10 years.

The menstrual cups that are made from silicone are much better for the environment, especially when compared to tampons and sanitary towels. Tampons and towels usually come wrapped in plastic, have plastic applicators and have a range of chemicals in them to increase their effectiveness. This means that they take a long time to degrade, and release harmful chemicals in the process.

However, silicone is a green ingredient, and when the menstrual cups degrade they reform silica, which is the natural component of silicone. This is the second most abundant component of the earth’s crust, and is not harmful to the environment.

## My experience

I did my research and decided to try the ‘mooncup’ which comes in two different sizes.

If i’m honest, I was terrified about trying a menstrual cup! Partly terrified about being unable to remove it, and partly terrified by reviews I’d read where people ended up throwing blood up the walls in the process.

However, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use! I had no issues removing or inserting the moon cup, and found the advised fit to be appropriate.

I do think that it does take some getting used to, and a few attempts at using the cup before I was confident enough to leave it in for a prolonged time. I think a few period cycles should be given to get used to using the menstrual cup, especially before using them when out and about. It can take some time before removal is perfected.

## Other benefits of menstrual cups

-   **You will save money overall –** It is approximately £20 to purchase a menstrual cup, but depending on the brand and type of cup you use, it could last up to 10 years before it needs replacing. This will save you a lot of money in the long run!
-   **The cups hold more fluids –** Menstrual cups are great for any stage of your period, and can hold more fluids than tampons. They can be left in for slightly longer, are great for night time use, and don’t have a drying out effect.
-   **Less leakages –** As long as the correct sized menstrual cup is used, a seal is created, decreasing the chance of leakages.
-   **Decreased chance of Toxic Shock Syndrome –** Some research suggests that there is a reduced chance of TSS when using menstrual cups compared with using tampons. However, it’s important to be cautious, changing the cup regularly and keeping it clean (It’s good to boil the cup, or use sterilising formula between periods to keep it clean)
-   **Always available when needed –** No worries of running out of tampons or pads, and needing to do last minute shopping.

## Cons of menstrual cups

-   **Takes some getting used to –** It takes a while to perfect the process of inserting and removing the cup. This means it may take a couple of months before you’re confident enough to use them out and about.
-   **Can be a bit scary at first –** I was very worried when first using the cup, but made sure i read all the instructions and kept calm. I found it was actually super easy to use!
-   **They require a bit more maintenance –** They need to be kept clean (as mentioned above) and stored properly, which means a bit more time is spent than with disposable products.

When your period is at its heaviest, reusable period pads can also be useful to catch any leaks, especially at night. These are just put into the wash, and reused!
