When using reusable wet wipes, some people choose to store wipes in a solutions, so they are already wet and ready to use when needed. This is one of the more convenient techniques, and they are great when leaving a child or baby with other carers, as they work in a similar way as normal wet wipes. Another benefit to these wipes is that they smell amazing, and are good at killing bacteria.

## Recipe

-   1 Â½ cups of water (I use water that has previously been boiled)
-   2 tbsp baby body wash or shampoo
-   2 tbsp baby oil
-   2 drops of lavender essential oil
-   2 drops of tea tree essential oil

The essential oils should be added in smaller quantities, or not at all for newborn babies, as their skin is very sensitive. However, they do give many benefits for older babies.

Lavender oil helps babies to sleep better, and reduces the likelihood of developing nappy rash.

Tea tree oil helps to kill bacteria, disinfects babies skin, and therefore, also helps to prevent nappy rash.

## Method

1. Simple add all the ingredients to a jug, and gently mix
2. Pour into a spray bottle, to spray wipes just before using. Otherwise, pour over wipes in a suitable container, and store already wet.

It is best not to make up more wipes than can be used in a couple of days, as they can become musty if left wet. To avoid this, prepare smaller amounts of wipes, or use a spray bottle, and spray wipes just before using them.
