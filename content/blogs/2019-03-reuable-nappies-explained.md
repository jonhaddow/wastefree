Hey all! This post will be looking at the different sizing and types of reusable nappies. This is a relatively brief explanation, but I hope it helps you have a better understanding of what each type consists of and some of their benefits. I hope you enjoy!

I have a previous post that explains the different components of cloth nappies, common misconceptions, some hints and tips, and the items I would recommend when getting started with reusable nappies. Here's the link: <https://wastefreemama.com/2019/02/28/switching-to-reusable-nappies/>

### Sizing

There are two main sizing differences in cloth nappies.

1. **Sized nappies** - These are similar to disposable nappies and come in a range of different sizes specific to the weight of your child. Most commonly they come in three sizes.

* Size 1: 7 to 18lbs
* Size 2: 18 to 35lbs
* Size 3: 35lb +

These are often a better fit for your baby, meaning there are less leakages. However, this is a more costly option, as you will need to purchase more nappies each time your child grows to the next size.

1. **Birth to potty nappies** - These are the type of nappy we use for our child, as they are the most cost effective. These have a range of snap fasteners and velcro that allow the nappies to be adjusted to suit your child as they grow. However, these usually start at around 8lbs, and are not often suitable for newborn babies.

### Types of nappies

There are five main types of reusable nappies available, each with differing properties. I will summarise them below, to help you decide which ones will be most suitable for you!

1. **Prefolds and covers** - These are the cheapest variety of reusable nappies, and are very similar to the old fashion techniques our grandparents most likely used. These consist of a single cotton cloth that is folded (there are many different folds you can use to increase absorbency) and wrapped around the baby, and a waterproof cover is placed over the top. These are great for newborns, as they are less bulky, decrease the chance of leakages and can be wrapped in a way to give a more secure fit. When purchasing these nappies, more cloth prefolds can be purchased than waterproof covers, as the covers can be used for 2-3 nappy changes as long as they have remained unsoiled.

2. **Pocket nappies** - These nappies have a pocket at the top, that the absortent inserts are added in to. When the inserts are added these resemble a disposable nappy, and are placed onto the baby in the same way. Boosters can be added into the pocket, to increase absorbency, which is usually required for night time use. These are slightly more expensive because the whole unit is replaced and washed at each nappy change, so more nappies are required than with other types. However, they are more convenient to use and can be pre-stuffed with the inserts to make nappy changes easier. These are great because they're not too bulky for daytime use.

3. **All in ones** - These are very similar to disposable nappies, in that the insert is attached to the waterproof cover of the nappies. The insert slots into a pocket, and looks very similar to a normal nappy, and are very easy to put on. The insert can be removed from the pocket for faster drying. The pocket allows for extra boosters to be added to maximise absorbency, especially during the night. These nappies are super simple, and the whole unit is removed and swapped at each nappy change. However, this does mean that the upfront cost is higher, as more nappies are required.

4. **All in two nappies** - These can sometimes be referred to as hybrid nappies. These are similar to type 1 (Prefolds and covers), in that the waterproof covers can be used for multiple changes, as long as they remain unsoiled. Inside these nappies an insert is added as the absorbent layer. The insert has snap fasteners, and fits onto the waterproof cover, to become a one piece nappy. These are great for daytime use, as they are less bulky.

5. **Fitted nappies** - These are completely absorbent nappies, that wrap around and are secured with velcro or snap fastens in a similar style as disposable nappies. A waterproof cover is placed over this nappy to keep fluids inside. These are the most absorbent form of nappy, and are great for newborns. They are fitted well, and suit most babies, but as the whole nappy works to absorb these can be extremely messy to change. They are a great nappy for night time use as they hold large quantities of fluid.

I hope this post helps to explain the variety of reusable nappies on offer, and makes choosing the best nappies for you a little bit easier!
